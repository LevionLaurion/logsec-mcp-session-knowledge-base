# LogSec Implementation Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-06

## Overview

LogSec 3.0 is a production-ready MCP knowledge management system with advanced Desktop Commander integration.

## Implemented Features

### Core System
- MCP Protocol 2024-11-05 compliant server
- Pure SQLite database storage (no file clutter)
- Project isolation with automatic classification
- Fast startup (~2 seconds with lazy loading)
- Duplicate prevention for all operations

### Desktop Commander Integration
- LogSniffer reads actual DC log files
- Automatic tracking of all file operations
- Real paths extracted from operations
- Project detection from paths
- Operation types tracked:
  - read_file, write_file, edit_block
  - list_directory, create_directory
  - search_files, search_code
  - execute_command, move_file

### API Functions
- **lo_start**: Quick start with continuation context
- **lo_load**: Two-mode operation (summary/search)
- **lo_save**: Auto-tracks DC operations from logs
- **lo_cont**: Uses real DC operations for context
- **lo_update**: Generates Tier 2 documentation

### Knowledge Architecture
- **Tier 1**: Quick summaries and recent activity
- **Tier 2**: Structured project documentation (DB stored)
- **Tier 3**: Full session database with search

### Advanced Features
- Lazy-loaded vector search (only when needed)
- 8-type knowledge classification
- Smart auto-tagging with NLP
- Confidence scoring for classifications
- Session embeddings for semantic search

## In Development

### Planned Enhancements
- Directory filtering (exclude node_modules, etc.)
- Session versioning/history
- Multi-project search
- Export functionality

## Performance 

- Lazy loading reduces startup time
- Vector search loads on first use only
- Database storage instead of file I/O

## Configuration Options

```python
# src/config.py
ENABLE_VECTOR_SEARCH = False  # True for semantic search
```

## Known Limitations

1. Vector search requires one-time loading (~20s)
2. DC operations only tracked during active sessions
3. No built-in backup mechanism (use git)

## Recent Updates (2025-07-06)

- Added LogSniffer for real DC log reading
- Implemented lazy loading for performance
- Added duplicate prevention with UNIQUE index
- Fixed lo_cont to use actual DC operations
- Cleaned up all file-based storage
- Updated all documentation
